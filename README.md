brackets-theme-solarized-animated
=================================

Theme for [Adobe's Brackets editor](http://brackets.io/); my own version of Solarized Light, with some animation to help with cursor-following and matching brackets.

Based on [Solarized_2014_Light Visual Studio theme](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/solarized_2014_light) by [Tony Dunsworth](http://programmeredu.wordpress.com/).  I used [MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Themes](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/Brackets-Themes) to import.  If you use that extention, this theme will show as `Solarized_l_a` (I didn't want long CSS names).

I use Brackets mostly to hack on HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, so it may not be optimized for other languages.  This is the first Brackets theme that I know of that uses [CSS animation](https://github.com/tomByrer/brackets-theme-solarized-animated/blob/master/solarized_l_a.css#L54).
